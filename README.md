# Hi, Glad to see you here! My name is Rohan Samuel Gangavarapu ðŸ’»

I'm a **Software Engineer** who specializes in **Full Stack Development** with a passion for building scalable and efficient systems. I am passionate about learning **new technologies** and keeping myself updated with the latest trends in the industry. I am looking for opportunities to work on challenging projects and to collaborate with other developers. I have been doing personal research on **AI** and **Algorithms** to see how old techniques helped pave the way for new techniques and how we can reduce the time complexity and latency in modern algorithms.

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on
- Developing AI-powered voice fallback systems for memory care patients using advanced transformer models and **real-time voice recognition**.
- Building an AI classroom assistant leveraging **AWS Bedrock**, Python, and Zoom AI to automate lecture transcription and student Q&A.
- Experimenting with generative AI for social media using **Mistral** models and statistical analysis.

---

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning
- Advanced platform engineering concepts to streamline developer workflows and accelerate delivery.
- Deepening expertise in cloud-native architectures, **Kubernetes**, and scalable microservices.
- Exploring the latest in **AI/ML frameworks**, including **PyTorch** and **Hugging Face Transformers**.

---

### ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on
- Open-source projects in AI, cloud computing, or platform engineering. Specially those centered around the entertainment industry. I want to create apps that help consume better and more relevant content.
- Initiatives that leverage data engineering to drive real-world impact, especially in healthcare or education.
- Building tools that simplify developer experience and automate operational tasks.

---

### ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with
- Generative AI approach which incorporates a separate knowledge based for image and textual data which have individual contexts and the model must be able to generate a next slide or page based off the previous page conveying necessary emotion and story.
- Optimizing distributed systems for low-latency, high-availability use cases.
- Navigating the latest trends in software engineering and developer productivity tooling.

---

### ðŸ’¬ Ask me about
- Working the way through leetcode and solving actual problems that are relevant for interviews and how to come up with the optimal approach for the provided question.
- AI/ML model deployment and real-time data processing.
- End-to-end software delivery: from prototyping to production and CI/CD automation.
